.sort()
db.foo.find().sort({x:1});
The 1 will sort ascending (oldest to newest) and -1 will sort descending (newest to oldest.)

If you use the auto created _id field it has a date embedded in it ... so you can use that to order by ...

db.foo.find().sort({_id:1});
That will return back all your documents sorted from oldest to newest.

Natural Order
You can also use a Natural Order mentioned above ...

db.foo.find().sort({$natural:1});
Again, using 1 or -1 depending on the order you want.

Use .limit()
Lastly, it's good practice to add a limit when doing this sort of wide open query so you could do either ...

db.foo.find().sort({_id:1}).limit(50);
or

db.foo.find().sort({$natural:1}).limit(50);
